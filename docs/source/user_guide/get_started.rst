Installation
++++++++++++
Currently, ``aiida-catmat`` works with ``aiida-core`` versions below ``2.0``.
We can install it using:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pzarabadip/aiida-catmat.git
    cd aiida-catmat
    pip install .

**NOTE** although it installs ``AiiDA`` along with ``aiida-vasp``, ``aiida-ddec``, and ``parsevasp``, you need to 
consult `AiiDA documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.5>`_ to learn about setting up an ``AiiDA`` environment and related stuffs such as
database, computers, and codes.
